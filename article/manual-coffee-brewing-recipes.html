<li>
<p>Ratio: 60g/l. I recommend this as a starting point for all pour-over and filter coffee methods, but be sure to experiment to find your preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grind: Medium/caster (superfine) sugar would be suitable for brewing around 30g coffee to 500g water. You will need to grind the beans more finely if you are brewing a single cup, and more coarsely if you want to brew more (see Grind Size).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grind the coffee just before you start brewing. Be sure to weigh the coffee first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boil a kettle of fresh water with a low mineral content, suitable for brewing coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the kettle is boiling, place the paper filter in the brewer and rinse briefly under the hot tap. This helps to reduce any taste the paper might impart to the coffee, and also warms up the brewing device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the coffee to the brewer, place the brewer on top of the cup or jug and place on the scales. <em>See A</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/_resources/0cba0b538f43491bba3d46e15a4db95f.jpeg" /></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Wait ten seconds once the kettle has boiled if you are pouring straight from it. If you are using a pouring kettle, decant the water into it immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the scales as a guide, pour a little water on to the coffee, about twice as much as the coffee by weight. Don’t worry about being too accurate, just make sure you add enough to wet the coffee. I like to pick the cone up and give it a little swirl to make sure all the coffee is wet. Careful stirring with a spoon is another option. Wait thirty seconds before starting to pour the rest of the water. <em>See B</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/_resources/fa16b71ae7fe40a3a32f3bed5951aaf7.jpeg" /></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Slowly pour the remainder of the water on to the coffee, weighing as you go to get an accurate amount and taking into account the water already added. Try to pour directly on the coffee and not the walls of the brewer as water may pass through without really extracting the coffee. <em>See C</em></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/_resources/10e4648094af4000b3c1bbf006f0df1d.jpeg" /></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Once you have added all the necessary water, and the surface of the liquid is 2–3cm (about 1in) below the top of the cone, give it a gentle swirl again. This stops any coffee from sticking to the walls of the brewer. <em>See D</em></li>

<li>Let it drip through until the bed of coffee looks dry. It should be relatively flat at the base of the brewer. <em>See E</em></li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you are not happy with the resulting cup of coffee, think about what you want to change. I would recommend using the grind to change the flavour of the coffee. If the coffee is bitter it may be overextracted so you should try your next brew using a slightly coarser grind. If it is weak, sour or astringent, try grinding the coffee more finely for the next brew. Very quickly you will know the best grind settings for the coffees you enjoy.</strong></p>

<li>Ratio: 75g/l. I recommend a slightly higher ratio of coffee to water when using an infusion brewer if you want to produce a brew with a strength similar to a pour-over brewer.</li>

<p>Leave the coffee to steep for four minutes. During this time the coffee will float to the top to form a crust-like layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After four minutes, take a large spoon and stir the crust at the top. This will cause most of the coffee to fall to the bottom of the brewer.</p>

<p>Wait another five minutes. The coffee would be too hot to drink anyway, and leaving it in the brewer allows more and more of the coffee and fine particles to sink to the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the mesh plunger in the top of the beaker, but do not plunge. Plunging will create turbulence, which will stir up all the silty coffee at the bottom of the pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the coffee slowly through the mesh into the cup(s). Until you get close to the bottom, this liquid will have very little silt in it. If you can resist pouring out the very last bit you will end up with a delicious, flavourful brew of coffee that has very little silt. <em>See C</em></p>

<p>The relationship between grind size, brew time and the amount of brewing water used is incredibly important here. For best results with an Aeropress, you should first decide what kind of cup of coffee you want to drink.</p>
<p>• If you want to brew something short and strong, I suggest starting with a ratio of 100g/l. If you want to brew a little quicker then you will need to grind relatively fine. You can use a coarser grind if you choose but you will need to extend the brewing time for best results.</p>
<p>• If you want something closer to a regular cup of coffee, I suggest using a ratio of 75g/l. This is the same ratio as that recommended for the French press because this is also an immersion brewing method. Again, you can match your brewing time to your grind size.</p>
<p>This method will allow you to brew slightly more coffee than the inverted method described below. It is also a little less fussy and there is less potential for mess in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Because there are so many factors at play, it is tempting to adjust many variables at once. Pushing harder will speed up the brew but also extract a little more from the coffee; extending the steep time will also extract more, as will grinding the coffee on a finer setting. However, it is always best to change only one thing at a time, and more experimentation simply means more opportunities to drink interesting cups of coffee.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grind the coffee just before you start brewing. Be sure to weigh the coffee first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a filter paper into the filter holder and lock into the body of the brewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run some hot water through to heat the brewer and rinse the paper.</p>

<p>Place a mug on your digital scales, put the main part of the brewer on top and add the coffee. <em>See A</em></p>

<p>Boil a kettle of fresh water with a low mineral content, suitable for brewing coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait ten to twenty seconds after the kettle has boiled, turn on the scales, then add the desired amount of water to the Aeropress (for example, for 15g of coffee I would add 200ml (200g) of water). Start a timer. <em>See B</em></p>

<li>Give the coffee a quick stir, then put the piston part of the Aeropress in place. Make sure it seals, but don’t push down yet. This creates a vacuum above the coffee, preventing the liquid from dripping out of the bottom of the brewer before you want it to. <em>See C</em></li>

<h2 id="inverted-method">Inverted Method</h2>
<h2 id="from-james-hoffmann-3">From <a title="https://youtu.be/j6VlT_jUVPc" href="https://youtu.be/j6VlT_jUVPc">James Hoffmann</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind this alternative method is to invert the device, so that it is impossible for the brewing liquid to escape during the infusion phase. You will have to flip over the brewer full of coffee on to a cup before you push the plunger and this is where things go wrong – vessels full of hot liquid should be flipped with caution. It is also important to note that this method will not allow you to brew as much coffee: the maximum brew is probably 200ml of water.</p>

<li>
<p>Grind the coffee just before you start brewing. Be sure to weigh the coffee first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a filter paper into the filter holder and lock into the body of the brewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run some hot water through to heat the brewer and rinse the paper.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ratio: 200g/l. In most cases, you do not have much control over the ratio. You simply fill up the ground coffee holder and then fill the unit with water until it reaches just below the overpressure valve, so there is little room for manoeuvre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grind: Quite fine/salt. I do not recommend using an espresso/very fine grind, a somewhat controversial stance. I prefer a slightly coarser grind than most people would choose because I prefer to minimize the bitterness in the resulting cup (see Grind Size).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grind the coffee just before you start brewing, and fill the basket so it is even and level. Do not compress the coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boil a kettle of fresh water with a low mineral content, suitable for brewing coffee. The advantage of starting with hot water is that the pot is on the heat for less time and the ground coffee doesn’t get as hot, which helps reduce the bitterness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill the bottom section of the brewer with hot water to just below the small valve. Do not cover it with water; it is a safety valve which prevents too much pressure from building up. <em>See A</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/_resources/ced8475bde7748c5ae8c93f28d052c88.jpeg" /></p>

<li>Put the coffee basket in place. Make sure the circular rubber gasket is completely clean, then carefully assemble the brewer. If this does not seal properly, the brewer will not work properly. <em>See B</em></li>

<li>Put the pot on a low to medium heat, leaving the lid up. When the water starts to boil in the lower chamber, the pressure created by the steam pushes the water through the tube that feeds it to the coffee. The faster and harder you boil the water, the more pressure you will create and the faster the brew process will be – you don’t want to go too quickly. <em>See C</em></li>

<li>
<p>Coffee should slowly start to appear in the top chamber. Listen carefully: when you hear a gurgling sound, it is time to turn off the heat and stop brewing. This sound indicates that most of the water has been pushed up already and that steam is now starting to come through the coffee, which will make the brew more bitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To stop the brew, run the base of the brewer under cold running water. This drop in temperature will cause the steam to condense and the pressure to disappear. <em>See D</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ratio: 75g/l. Some people prefer to use a little more coffee than this for syphon brewing, especially in Japan where this method is commonly used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grind: Medium/caster sugar. Because this is an immersion method, you can match your brew time to the grind size. I would caution against going too fine as you can stall the draw-down process to end the brewing. A very coarse grind will mean a very long brew time at higher temperatures, which can make the brew rather bitter (see Grind Size).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grind the coffee just before you start brewing. Be sure to weigh the coffee first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boil a kettle of fresh water with a low mineral content, suitable for brewing coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fit the filter into the upper chamber, making sure it is completely flush.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the bottom chamber on your digital scales and pour in your calculated amount of hot water, following your desired ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the lower chamber to your heat source (a small butane burner, an alcohol burner or a halogen lamp, as shown here) using the handle to move it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the upper chamber on top, but do not seal it yet. If you put the seal on too soon, the expanding gases will push the water up into the top chamber before it is the right temperature, making your coffee taste bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the water starts to boil, seal the top chamber on top of the lower chamber. If you are using a controllable heat source, reduce the heat to low at this point. The boiling water will now start pushing up into the top chamber. Look directly down on the filter to make sure it is centred: if it isn’t, you will see lots of bubbles flowing from one side. Use your paddle or a spoon to push the filter carefully into place so it is correctly positioned.</p>
